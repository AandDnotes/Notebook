          <p><img class="rns" src="images/Scratch.png">You may have already used the coding language called Scratch at school. You can download the Scratch app from <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/download/" target="_blank">the Scratch web site</a> so that you can use the editor without an internet connection or use it in the browser by just going <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">here</a> and clicking on 'Create'. You choose a 'sprite', (you can see a cat here) and then link together blocks to make one or more programs for it. Each sprite has its own set of programs. There are some 'getting started' videos <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/help/videos/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <p>I decided to experiment with the animation of a bouncing ball. There are two sprites, a ball and a duck, and a little bit of maths to calculate how fast the ball is moving up and down. Try running the animation.</p>
          <p>You might like to think of something you could do and create your own animation. See what you can create.</p>
