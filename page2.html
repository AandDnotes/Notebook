          <h1>Face Masks</h1>
          <p>Lots of people are wearing face masks to help stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Different countries have different rules. In England people must wear a face mask if they are travelling on a bus or train and are asked to wear one if they are in a crowded place.</p>
          <p><img class="r" src="images/IMG_0807.jpg">Grandma made these face masks. She sewed mine from an old tea towel that was in my rag bag in the garage. Her's was made from part of an old cushion cover. Both have a lining , made from an old sheet, and a pocket for another rectangle of fabric. So they can feel quite hot when wearing them. Grandma's face mask has loops of elastic that go around her ears, but mine has elastic that goes around the back of my head. Grandma thinks that I look like a frog when I'm wearing mine!</p>
          <p>We went to the supermarket this morning to do our weekly shop. Grandma went into the store while I went to the cash machine to get some money and then sat in the car and phoned Great Granddad. He is well, but finding the weather a bit hot. Neither of us needed to wear our face masks.</p>
