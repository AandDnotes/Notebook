        <p><img class="r" src="images/clown.png">Now I programme computers as a hobby. I have used a programming language called Scratch, which uses blocks that you join together. You can see a Scratch program on the right. The program makes the clown blink, makes his nose light up and spins his bowtie when you press buttons and turn knobs.</p>
        <p>The smallest computer that I have is a Raspberry Pi. I expect that Rowan's Daddy and Austin's Daddy have a Raspberry Pi. You can see my Pi on the desk in a clear plastic box just behind the keyboard.</p>
        <p><img class="r" src="images/rasPi.jpg">I don't have a screen and keyboard to plug into the Pi, so I have connected it with a cable to my Mac computer. I can then use the Mac's keyboard and mouse and the Pi's desktop is shown in the window on the screen. Within the Pi desktop you can see a browser window displaying my simple web page that I talked about on an earlier page.</p>
        <p>Later I plugged the Pi into our wi-fi router (via our electricity cables and two little boxes that Austin's Daddy gave me) so that it could use the Internet.</p>
