          <h1>Even Smaller Computers</h1>
          <p><video class="v1" src="images/arduino.mp4" controls></video>On the previous pages I said that my smallest computer is a Raspberry Pi. I think of a computer as having an Operating System. That is, some software that reads the keyboard and mouse and passes data to an app, then gets display and sound data from the app and puts it on the screen. Laptops and tablets have an operating system and the Pi uses one called Linux. But I have other small computers that don't use an operating system, they just run your program. One type is called an Arduino. If you look carefully at the video you can see two small blue boards in amongst the wires. One is reading the position of the joystick and sending the information by radio to the other, which is moving the rudder and elevator on the model of an aeroplane's tailplane. I wrote the programs that are running in the two Arduinos.</p>
          <p><video class="v1" src="images/microBit01.mp4" controls></video>The other small computer I have is called a micro:bit. It has some lights and some buttons. You can see that the micro:bit is much smaller that the Raspberry Pi. If you run the video you will see that I've programmed it so that if I press one button it displays a smiley face, but if I press the other button it shows a sad face. Pressing both buttons together does something else. Towards the end of the video you can see that to program the micro:bit you drag blocks on to the right side of the screen.</p>
          <p>There are lots of interesting things that you can do with a micro:bit. Perhaps I'll show you some later.</p>
