        <h6>Granddad's Notebook</h6>
        <p>I thought that Rowan, Austin and Juniper (with some help from Austin) might like to see some of the things that Grandma and I do. So I started this notebook. I will not write in the notebook every day, just when we have done something that you might find interesting. I am quite busy reading, writing, doing sums, making things and doing jobs around the house.</p>
