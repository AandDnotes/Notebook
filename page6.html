          <h1>Car Horn - Part 2</h1>
          <p><img class="rss" src="images/horn2020.jpg"><img class="rss" src="images/horn2016.jpg">I told you that the horn on my MG car does not work. When I looked at it I also found that the front cover and the shiny nut that holds it on had come off! You can see the difference between these two photos. The bits must have fallen off when I was driving the car, so I have lost those parts. I have ordered some new parts from someone called 'Taff the Horn'. He lives in Wales and often people in Wales are called Taff.</p>
          <p><img class="r" src="images/IMG_0818small.jpg">You can see from this photo that I have taken the horn apart. One of the nuts was very tight and I had to hit the end of the spanner with a hammer.</p>
          <p>I was able to clean the switch that turns the electricity on and off and then put the horn back together and adjust it.</p>
