          <h1>Pong</h1>
          <p>When your Mummy and Daddy were your age we didn't have computers in our homes and so there were few computer games. One of the early games was called Pong. I thought it would be fun to write my own version of Pong. Run the video to see how the game works.</p>
          <video class="v3" controls>
            <source src="images/pong720p.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
          <p>On other pages I've talked about creating web pages using html and creating animations using Scratch. Here I decided to use the programming language python. The original pong was in black and white, but I thought I would add some colour. I used the 'a' and 'q' keys to move the bat for player one up and down and the up and down arrow keys for player two. There is a button for each player to serve a new ball and each player's score is shown in the bottom bar.</p>
          <p>You could make up your own computer game and create it using Scratch. See what you can think of. Go to the previous page of this Notebook to find out about Scratch.</p>
