            </video>Well, I cleaned the parts of my car's horn and sprayed them with two coats of primer. Primer is a type of paint that can go on to bare metal and forms a good surface for pianting. I then gave the parts two coats of matt (not shiny) black paint.</p>
          <p>Then the parts that I had ordered from 'Taff the Horn' arrived. So I put the parts of the horn back together. I had to find the right spacing between the bit that makes the sound and the body of the horn. This is done using a number of circular pieces of thick paper, called shims, that I got from Taff. Then I had to adjust the point at which the switch opens. It took quite a while to do this, but you can see the result by playing the video clip.</p>
          <p>You can just see in the video clip that I am holding the horn in a vice that is fixed to my bench in the garage. A vice is a useful tool for holding things tightly while you are working on them.</p>
          <p>I will do some final adjustments and then refit the horn on the front of the car and connect up the wires so that, when I press the horn push inside the car, the horn will sound.</p>
